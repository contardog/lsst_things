# lsst_things

1. Some code to generate synthetic TDE light-curves from MOSIFT and using LSST OpSim baseline (currently v4.0) to mimick LSST observations. No limiting magnitude added, no dust, use only the first year of v4.0 because of the way the new observation strategy is built.



Thanks to Alex Gagliano, Ashley Villar and Katja Bricman for part of this code.
